# Heart Failure Analysis Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of heart failure patient data using Tableau. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, survival statistics, and correlations between various health conditions and survival outcomes.

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard explores heart failure data to understand patterns and factors associated with survival. It includes visualizations for demographic breakdowns, survival rates based on comorbidities, and correlations between health measurements and survival outcomes.


## Features

- **Total Individuals**: Displays the total count of individuals in the dataset.
- **Survival by Condition**: Donut charts show survival rates based on conditions like diabetes, anaemia, smoking status, high blood pressure, and gender.
- **Age Distribution and Survival**: Bar and box plots showing survival rates across age groups, by gender.
- **Serum Creatinine and Platelets**: Visualizes the distribution of serum creatinine and platelet counts among survivors and non-survivors.
- **Other Health Metrics**: Additional graphs for time, serum sodium, creatinine phosphokinase, and ejection fraction in relation to survival status.

## Visualizations

- **Donut Charts**: Provide a quick look at survival statistics based on comorbidities.
- **Histograms and Box Plots**: Show the distribution and central tendency of numeric variables like age, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction.
- **Scatter Plots**: Present relationships between continuous variables and survival status.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this dashboard includes various health indicators for heart failure patients, such as age, gender, smoking status, and specific health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, serum sodium levels).

## How to Use

1. **Filter Options**: Use the filters on top of each graph (e.g., by gender) to focus on specific subgroups.
2. **Interactive Visualizations**: Hover over elements in the charts to view detailed data points.
3. **Download & Access**: Ensure you have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed to open and interact with the .twb file.

## Requirements

- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public
- Heart failure patient dataset (available in the Tableau workbook)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-failure-tableau.git
   ```
2. Open the `.twb` file in Tableau.
3. Explore the dashboard to analyze heart failure data.
